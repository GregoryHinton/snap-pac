SYNOPSIS

This is a set of pacman hooks and script that automatically causes snapper to
perform a pre and post snapshot before and after pacman transactions, similar to
how YaST does with OpenSuse. This provides a simple way to undo changes to a
system after a pacman transaction.

INSTALLATION

Install the "snap-pac" package using pacman. Alternatively clone the repository
and run "make install". I have signed the release tarball and commits with my
PGP key. The key's fingerprint is "8535CEF3F3C38EE69555BF67E4B5E45AA3B8C5C3".

DOCUMENTATION

See snap-pac(8) after installation.
